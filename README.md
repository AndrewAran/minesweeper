# Minesweeper

Modern and open-source reimplementation of the classic puzzle game Minesweeper

This is a very similar game to the original game with the same name. It was created to fill the gap after the original's removal from modern Windows releases. 

The objective is to carefully clear all the mines on a square board, without detonating them.
